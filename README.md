# Lift-Off

Lift-Off is a very simple exercise in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application presents a small canvas with a rocket and a launch button. Once
clicked, a countdown begins before actually launching the rocket into space.

The goal of this exercise is to expose the individual to some basic HTML tags,
relatively simple styling with CSS, and some basic JavaScript usage and concepts.
