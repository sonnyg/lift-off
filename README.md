# Lift-Off

Lift-Off is a very simple exercise in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application presents a small canvas with a rocket and a launch button. Once
clicked, a countdown begins before actually launching the rocket into space.

The goal of this exercise is to expose the individual to some basic HTML tags,
relatively simple styling with CSS, and some basic JavaScript usage and concepts.

Goals of project:
1. Basic introduction to standard web technologies
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
2. Introduce some development best practices
  - VCS (using git)
  - Dev diary (in the form of a README)
  -
Thoughts on how to organize exercise:

1. Start with HTML layout
  - Empty document, what it means (at a high level)
  - Cover some basic elements
2. Layer on styling (CSS), probably over several smaller exercises
  - How to style an element
  - How to define a class
  - How to style a specific element
  - Start with inline CSS
  - Move to in-file
  - Move to external file
3.
